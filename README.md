# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
For this project, I built an interactive back end for an e-commerce site. In this project, the user can navigate and manipulate the e-commerce database that contains products, categories, and tags. When the user selects one of the many requests in Insomnia, he or she will be met with specific items, full lists, opportunities to change variables, opportunities to add items, and opportunities to delete items for the products, categories, and/or tags.

## Usage
To use this application, the user must install Mysql, Sequalize, Node, Express, Nodemon, and Insomnia. When the user opens the application, he or she can enter "npm i" into the integrated terminal to begin the installation of these items. From there, the user can enter "node server.js" or "nodemon server.js" (for a server that refreshes continuously despite changes to the code). When the user receives a console message "Now listening", he or she can enter the appropriate URL endpoints into Insomnia to test the various endpoints specified in the different routes pages.
